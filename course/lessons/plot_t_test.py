# Opening the dataset
# ----------------------------
#
# First we open the data. For this example we will use WyScout data from 2017/18 Premier League season.  To meet file size requirements of 
# Github, we have to open it from different files,
# but you can open the file locally from the directory you saved it in. Also, we open the file containing all teams in WyScout database.

#open events
train = pd.DataFrame()
for i in range(13):
    file_name = f'events_England_{str(i + 1)}.json'
    path = os.path.join(str(pathlib.Path().resolve()), 'data', 'Wyscout', file_name)
    with open(path) as f:
        data = json.load(f)
    train = pd.concat([train, pd.DataFrame(data)])

#open team data
path = os.path.join(str(pathlib.Path().resolve()),"data", 'Wyscout', 'teams.json')
with open(path) as f:
    teams = json.load(f)

teams_df = pd.DataFrame(teams)
teams_df = teams_df.rename(columns={"wyId": "teamId"})

# Preparing the dataset
# ----------------------------
#
# First, we take out corners. Then, we sum them by team. We also merge it together with team dataframe to keep their names.
# Then we repeat the same, but calculate corners taken by each team per game. 

#get corners
corners = train.loc[train["subEventName"] == "Corner"]
#count corners by team
corners_by_team = corners.groupby(['teamId']).size().reset_index(name='counts')
#merge with team name
summary = corners_by_team.merge(teams_df[["name", "teamId"]], how = "left", on = ["teamId"])
#count corners by team by game
corners_by_game = corners.groupby(['teamId', "matchId"]).size().reset_index(name='counts')
#merge with team name
summary2 = corners_by_game.merge(teams_df[["name", "teamId"]], how = "left", on = ["teamId"])

# Two-sided z-test
# ----------------------------

# We use two-sided z-test to check if Manchester City take 8 corners per game. We set the significance level at 0.05.
# At this significance level, there's no reason to reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, we claim that City takes
# 8 corners per game.
