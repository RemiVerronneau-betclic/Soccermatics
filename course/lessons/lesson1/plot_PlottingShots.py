# Opening the dataset
# ----------------------------
# The first thing we have to do is open the data. We use a parser SBopen available in mplsoccer.
# Using method *event* and putting the id of the game as a parameter we load the data.
# The event data, which we will mostly focus on,
# is stored in a dataframe *df*. From this dataframe we take out the names of the two teams.
# Then, we filter the dataframe so that only shots are left.

parser = Sbopen()
df, related, freeze, tactics = parser.event(69301)
#get team names
team1, team2 = df.team_name.unique()
#A dataframe of shots
shots = df.loc[df['type_name'] == 'Shot'].set_index('id')

# Making the shot map using iterative solution
# ----------------------------
# First let's draw the pitch using the `MPL Soccer class <https://mplsoccer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gallery/pitch_setup/plot_pitches.html>`_,
#
# In this example, we set variables for pitch length and width to the Statsbomb coordinate system (they use yards).
# You can read more about `different coordinate systems here <https://mplsoccer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gallery/pitch_setup/plot_compare_pitches.html>`_
#
# Now, we iterate through all the shots in the match. We take *x* and *y* coordinates, the team name and information
# if goal was scored. If It was scored, we plot a solid circle with a name of the player, if not, we plot a
# transculent circle (parameter alpha tunes the transcluency).
# To have England's shots on one half and Sweden shots on the other half,
# we subtract *x* and *y* from the pitch length and height.
#
# Football data tends to be attacking left to right, and we will use this as default in the course.

pitch = Pitch(line_color = "black")
fig, ax = pitch.draw(figsize=(10, 7))
#Size of the pitch in yards (!!!)
pitchLengthX = 120
pitchWidthY = 80
#set circlesize
circleSize=2
#Plot the shots by looping through them.
for i,shot in shots.iterrows():
    #get the information 
    x=shot['x']
    y=shot['y']
    goal=shot['outcome_name']=='Goal'
    team_name=shot['team_name']
    #plot England
    if (team_name==team1):
        shotCircle=plt.Circle((x,y),circleSize,color="red")
        if goal:
            plt.text(x+1,y-2,shot['player_name'])

            shotCircle.set_alpha(.2)

        if goal:
            plt.text(pitchLengthX-x+1,pitchWidthY - y - 2 ,shot['player_name'])

# Using mplsoccer's Pitch class
# ----------------------------
# This time we make a direct query to return only shots by each team.
# We only need the columns with cooridnates, outcome (showing if goal was scored),
# and player name. If a goal was scored, we use scatter method
# to plot a circle and annotate method to mark scorer's name.
# If not, we use scatter method to draw a translucent circle. 
# Note that, once again, to plot the shots on different halves we needed to reverse the coordinates for Sweden.
# Using pitch.scatter we could have plotted all shots using one line. 
# However, since name of a player and alpha differs if goal was scored,
# it was more convenient to loop through smaller dataset.

#create pitch
pitch = Pitch(line_color='black')

#query
mask_england = (df.type_name == 'Shot') & (df.team_name == team1)
#finding rows in the df and keeping only necessary columns

#plot them - if shot ended with Goal - alpha 1 and add name
#for England

    if row["outcome_name"] == 'Goal':
    #make circle

# Plotting shots on one half
# ----------------------------
# To plot shots of only one team on one half we use VerticalPitch() class
# If you set *half* to *True*, you will plot only one half of the pitch.
# It is a nice way of plotting shots since they rarely occur on the defensive half.
# We plot all the shots at once this time, without looping through the dataframe this time.

# Challenge - try it before looking at the next page
# ----------------------------
# 1) Create a dataframe of passes which contains all the passes in the match
# 2) Plot the start point of every Sweden pass. Attacking left to right.
# 3) Plot only passes made by Caroline Seger (she is Sara Caroline Seger in the database)
# 4) Plot arrows to show where the passes went to.
